# Basic Graphics Library

## Name
Current Name: WFM (Window for Mac) 

## About
My goal is to develop a basic graphics library from scratch, without relying on existing frameworks like SDL2 or SFML. I focused on constructing a window from the ground up using the Cocoa API and Objective-C since I use a Mac. However, I also want to ensure that the library is cross-platform and can run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

To make the library accessible to everyone, I plan on making it open-source, allowing anyone to use, modify, or contribute to it. As I continue building the code, I may make adjustments to the folder structure to optimize it.
