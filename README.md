# Basic Graphics Library

## Name
Current Name: WFM (Window for Mac) 


## About
My objective is to develop a basic graphics library from the ground up without relying on existing libraries such as SDL2 or SFML. I aimed to construct a window from scratch and thus, I invested time in learning how to do it using the Cocoa API and Objective-C since I utilize a Mac. However, my ultimate goal is to ensure that the library is compatible with multiple operating systems, namely Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
