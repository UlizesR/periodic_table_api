# Basic Graphics Library

## Name
Current Name: WFM (Window for Mac) 


## About
I want to build a simple graphics library from scratch. I don't want to use libraries like SDL2, SFML and etc to make this library. I wanted to build a window from scratch, so I learned how to do it. I use a Mac so I had to learn how to use the Cocoa API and Objective-C to be able to create a window.
I want this to be cross-platform so it can be runned on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
